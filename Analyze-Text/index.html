  To demonstrate this program, it's just done on window load though.
  NOTE: This program implies that the CMU IPA dictionary (http://people.umass.edu/nconstan/CMU-IPA/)
  has been loaded with loadDict(). This dictionary is by default included with this
  program under the name 'ipadict.txt'. This _WILL NOT WORK_ with any other IPA dictionary.
